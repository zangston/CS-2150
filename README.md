# CS 2150
 All of my coding work for CS 2150 - Program and Data Representation

This version of CS 2150 was co-taught by Aaron Bloomfield and Mark Floryan in the Fall semester of 2021. The course covers the basics of using a UNIX environment, developing in C/C++ and x86 Assembly, writing Bash shell scripts and makefiles, and many data structures such as linked lists, AVL trees, and priority queues.

I made this repository public in January of 2023 as the UVA Computer Science department's changes to the curriculum has made it so that CS 2150 is no longer offered to CS students and I won't be committing an honor violation by making my work public. If you are a professor and you are seeing this and would like me to make this repository private again, please email me at wyz5rge@virginia.edu and I will do so immediately.
